## 📌 Featured Projects

## 🔐 Smart Wallets & Account Abstraction (Professional Work)

As part of a Zapier-like automation platform, I worked on **smart wallet infrastructure**
to enable seamless, gas-abstracted blockchain interactions.

- Designed and implemented **Smart Contract Wallets**
- Integrated **ERC-2771 meta-transactions** for gasless user actions
- Executed user operations using **ERC-4337 Account Abstraction**
- Built relayer-friendly flows for automated transaction execution
- Focused on secure signature validation, nonce handling, and replay protection

**Tech:** Solidity, Ethers.js, Node.js, Hardhat  
> Note: This work was implemented in private repositories as part of professional projects.

### 🔗 Blockchain Cryptocurrency Wallet (From Scratch)
- Built a basic blockchain, wallet, mining & transaction logic
- Implemented cryptographic signing and validation
- **Tech:** JavaScript, Crypto, Blockchain fundamentals  
➡️ Repo: `Blockchain-Cryptocurrency-wallet-from-scratch`

---

### 🌉 Smart Contract & Bridge Systems
- Worked on **upgradeable (UUPS) smart contracts**
- Designed token locking, rollback, admin controls
- Event-based cross-chain handling  

---

### ⚙️ Backend Event & Transaction Systems
- Webhook listeners for smart contract events
- ABI decoding using `ethers.Interface.parseLog`
- PostgreSQL-based event storage and pagination

---

## 📈 What I'm Currently Working On
